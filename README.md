# üñçÔ∏è Crayons
A backend API for ordering supplies for a classroom built with Sequelize, SQLite, and Express 
<br></br>

## Features 
- Give me a list of all students, classrooms, or supplies
    - show me everything at once
    - show me 10 at a time 

- Give me details about a particular classroom: 
    - How many students are in the classroom? 
    - Does a classroom have too high of a student-to-teacher ratio?
    - What's the average grade of students in the classroom? 

- Give me details about supplies to help me order the correct amount for my class: 
    - How many left-handed scissors do I need? how many do I have?
    - Show me a list of all of the supplies that I have that are writing tools.
